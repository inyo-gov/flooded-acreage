# Flooded Acreage Monitoring Dashboard

This project provides automated monitoring of flooded acreage in the Blackrock Waterfowl Management Area using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The system generates both individual flood reports and a comprehensive dashboard with time series visualization.

Currently the requirement to quantify flooded acreage has been implemented by field workers physically walking the wetted extent with a handheld GPS, which can take up to 8 person days in the field every time it is needed. The current requirements mandate this be done around November 1 and March 1 time periods. This application provides: 1) instantaneous flooded acreage estimates for the Nov 1 and Mar 1 periods, rather than multiple days of field work, and 2) acreage estimates throughout the year, every five days or whenever cloud-free Sentinel scenes are available. 

Sentinel 2 provides 10m resolution in Band 8 near-infrared, whereas Landsat resolution is 30m. The improved resolution of Sentinel over Landsat and improvements in availability of this imagery from earth engine's archive drove the development of this work. There are thousands of papers, and dozens of water indices used to quantify open water, yet they all use some combination of near infrared, short-wave infrared, or ratios of these. Here a simple thresholding of NIR is where I've started and it yields good results with a few validation points that will be obtained for the official Nov 1 and Mar 1 time periods to help calibrate the threshold for reporting purposes.

## Dashboard

The project includes a comprehensive dashboard that displays:

- **Time Series Plot**: Monthly flooded acreage trends by unit
- **Interactive Table**: Links to all historical reports organized by fiscal year
- **Current Report Display**: Embedded iframe showing the most recent flood report

Access the dashboard at: `docs/index.html`

## Individual Reports

Here is an example of an individual flood report generated by the project:

## Introduction

This project is designed to compute the flooded acreage within specified units using Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance imagery. The analysis involves:
- Filtering imagery based on cloud cover and dates.
- Applying a threshold to the NIR band to identify flooded areas.
- Calculating the area of flooded pixels within predefined units.
- Generating visual and tabular reports.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Earth Engine API
- Geopandas
- Geemap
- Pandas
- Folium

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/inyo-gov/flooded-acreage.git
   cd flooded-acreage
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Authenticate with Google Earth Engine:

   ```sh
   earthengine authenticate
   ```

## Usage

### Generate New Flood Report

Use the Python script to generate a new flood report:

```sh
python flood_report.py <date> <threshold>
```

Example:
```sh
python flood_report.py '2025-09-17' 0.15
```

### View the Dashboard

The dashboard is automatically generated and available at:
- Local: `docs/index.html`
- GitHub Pages: `https://inyo-gov.github.io/flooded-acreage/`

### Update the Dashboard

After generating new reports, update the dashboard:

```sh
quarto render index.qmd
```

### Parameters

- **Surface Reflectance Threshold**: A value to threshold the NIR band for water detection.
- **Start Date**: The starting date for filtering Sentinel-2 imagery.
- **End Date**: Computed as start date + 15 days.
- **Bounding Box Coordinates**: Define the area of interest for the analysis.

### Example

```python
# Parameters
threshold = .16
start_date = '2024-06-06'

# Compute the end date
end_date = (datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d') + timedelta(days=15)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Define the bounding box coordinates
bbox = [[-118.23240736400778, 36.84651455123723],
        [-118.17232588207419, 36.84651455123723],
        [-118.17232588207419, 36.924364295139625],
        [-118.23240736400778, 36.924364295139625]]
```

## Example Analysis

### Step 1: Import Libraries

```python
import ee
import geopandas as gpd
import geemap
import pandas as pd
import folium
import geemap.foliumap as geemap
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os
```

### Step 2: Authenticate and Initialize Earth Engine

```sh
# Run this in terminal to authenticate with gcloud
earthengine authenticate
```

```python
# Initialize Earth Engine
ee.Initialize()
```

### Step 3: Filter and Process Imagery

```python
# Filter sentinel 2 surface reflectance imagery
sentinel_collection = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED') \
    .filterBounds(bounding_box_geometry) \
    .filterDate(start_date, end_date) \
    .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 30)) \
    .select(['B8', 'SCL'])  # Select NIR band (B8) and Scene Classification Layer (SCL) for masking clouds
```

#### HTML Map

```python
# Create and save HTML map
Map.save(map_filename)
```

#### HTML Report

```python
# Create HTML report
html_report = f"""

        <p>Flooded acres were calculated from Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance imagery using the Earth Engine Python API in a Jupyter notebook.  Sentinel-2 (S2) is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multispectral imaging mission with a global 5-day revisit frequency.</p>
        <p>The S2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) samples 13 spectral bands: Visible and NIR at 10 meters, red edge and SWIR at 20 meters, and atmospheric bands at 60 meters spatial resolution. The Near Infrared (NIR) band was used to identify flooded areas by applying a threshold to isolate water.</p>
        <p>The results are validated during routine field checks throughout the seasonal flooding cycle September through April.</p>
