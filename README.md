# flooded-acreage
This project uses sentinel 2 satellite data to threshold band 8 NIR into water and non-water pixels. Then calculates the acreage of water within each flooding unit in Blackrock Waterfowl Management Area (BWMA). It creates a report with summary acreages and a folium map of flooding. It takes the start date and a surface reflectance threshold value.
